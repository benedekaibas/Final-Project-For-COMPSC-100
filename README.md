This is my repository for the final project COMPSC - 100: Computational Expression

# Match the Player With The Racket
> Final Project for COMPSC - 100

My repository contains all the codes and details of my final project. 

## Idea

My idea was to make a game that tests the knowledge of tennis enthusiasts. The point of the game is to match the player with his racket
and get scores based on how well your matches were. This project is good for showing the learning outcomes of the class. 

## A quick look of the game

## Files 

There are two files this project contains. 

The main.py is the main file of the project. It contains all the code that we need to run the program. 
The test.py file is where I worked on the code. This is a working file to be able to work efficiently.
